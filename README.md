# Zabbix Whatsapp Notify

Webhook Api for receiving alerts and sending to whatsapp group/user. It runs on node js with multiple way to deploy like docker,systemd service or just node js  **npm run start**   .  We  use [Baileys](https://baileys.wiki/docs/intro/) library for whatsapp communication and cron for scheduling of events like sending .
